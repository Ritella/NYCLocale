# NYCLocale

<br><br>Hi, my name is Rita Loiotile.<br>I was born and raised in Brooklyn.
      <br>Even as a native New Yorker, I never felt like I had enough knowledge of where to go in Queens.
      <br>For this reason, I avoided exploring it on my own.
      <br>NYCLocal(e) aims to help people overcome this decision paralysis by giving greater context to NYC outer boroughs.
      <br>The heat map reflects cultural hotspots.
      <br><br>I determined where New Yorkers spend their leisure time, by analyzing <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Liquor-Authority-Quarterly-List-of-Active-Licenses/hrvs-fxs2">liquor licenses</a> and <a href="http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html">subway turnstile data</a>, both available at opendata.cityofnewyork.us.
      <br>These datasets gave me proxies of nightlife activity and weekend foot traffic, respectively.
      <br>Using these data, I performed an Independent Component Analysis to model leisure activity.
      <br>Finally, I validated my model with another dataset-- <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a">building construction permits</a>.
      <br>Areas with a high amount of new construction predicted areas of increased weekend subway traffic.
